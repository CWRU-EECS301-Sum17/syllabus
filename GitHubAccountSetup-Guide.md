# GitHub Account Setup

Opening the invitation link, included in the Lab #1 Assignment email, begins the process of creating your **GitHub** account, joining the class **GitHub Organization**, and starting the Lab #1 Assignment.  Follow the steps below to get started.

**Setup Steps:**

1. Open the Lab Assignment invitation link (from the Lab Assignment email) to go to the **GitHub Classroom** log-on page.

2. If you do not have a **GitHub** account, then click the ***Create an account*** link at the bottom of the page to sign-up for a free account following these guidelines:

	* Pick a professional username (something you'd feel fine listing on a résumé)
	* Use your CWRU email account (to be eligible for the Student Developer Pack)
	* Choose the **Free** sign-up option

	**NOTE:** If you already have a GitHub account you may use it for the class.

	:information_source: The following guide may provide additional help with the sign-up process: [GitHub Account Setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Account-Setup-and-Configuration)
	
3. Sign into **GitHub** using your new or existing account.

	**WARNING:** You may be prompted with an **"Authorize GitHub Classroom"** page.  GitHub Classroom requires access to your account to generate your lab assignment repositories.  Click the **Authorize github** button to allow access. 

4. After your **GitHub** account is setup:

	1. E-mail your **GitHub** username to the instructor so you can be added to the class **GitHub Student Team**.

	1. Optionally, signup for GitHub's [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) (although it's not required for this course).

	1. Run thought the [hello-world](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial to learn how GitHub works.
	
		**NOTE:** For this class, repositories are automatically generated and the branching and pull request mechanisms will not be required so Steps 1, 2, and 4 of the tutorial are not essential (but still useful to know about). Learning to **commit** changes in Step 3 will be needed for the labs.

5. **GitHub Classroom** should have automatically created a Lab #1 Assignment repository for you in the [**EECS301 GitHub Organization**](https://github.com/CWRU-EECS301-Sum17).

	Open the [EECS301 GitHub Home](https://github.com/CWRU-EECS301-Sum17) link, click on the Lab #1 Assignment repository and scroll-down the page to view "Lab #1 Assignment" document (_README.md_) for the full lab assignment details.
