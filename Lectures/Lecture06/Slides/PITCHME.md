## Serial Bus Protocols

* SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
* I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
* UNI/O (One-Wire)

---

### SPI BUS

* 3-wire (Clock, Bi-direction Data, Chip-select)
* 4-wire (Clock, Data In, Data Out, Chip-select)
* Many different device dependent protocols
* Point-to-point or shared bus using Chip Selects
* Used for interfacing Memory, ADC, DAC, etc...

### I<sup>2</sup>C BUS

* 2-wire (Clock and Bi-directional Data)
* Multi-drop Bus
* Standardized protocol with device addressing
* Most devices support 400kHz Fast-Mode.
* Speeds up to 5MHz with latest Ultra Fast-Mode
