## FPGA Computations

* FPGA fabric ALMs optimized for addition
	* 2-bits per ALM (Cyclone V)
	* Fast-Carry Chains
* Possible to implement Multipliers with ALMs
	* Requires lots of resources
	* Limited clock rates due to combinatorial layers
* Most FPGA architectures provide Hard-IP multipliers

---

## FPGA DSP Blocks

* Hard-IP to support Digital Signal Processing 
* Fused Multiplier and Accumulators
* Internal Pipeline Registers
* Carry-chains to combine multiple DSP Blocks
* Tailored for most common algorithms
