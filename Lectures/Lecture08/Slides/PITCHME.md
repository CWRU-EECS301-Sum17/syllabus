## FPGA Computations

* FPGA fabric ALMs optimized for addition
	* 2-bits per ALM (Cyclone V)
	* Fast-Carry Chains
* Possible to implement Multipliers with ALMs
	* Requires lots of resources
	* Limited clock rates due to combinatorial layers
* Most FPGA architectures provide Hard-IP multipliers

---

## FPGA DSP Blocks

* Hard-IP to support Digital Signal Processing
* Optimized propagation times for high clock rates
* Fused Multiplier and Accumulators (FMA)
* Internal Pipeline Registers
* Carry-chains to combine multiple DSP Blocks
* Tailored for most common MAC algorithms
* 5CSEMA5F31 FPGA has 87 DSP Blocks

Note:
Hard-IP are FPGA features implemented in Silicon instead of FPGA fabric.
MAC = Multiply-accumulate
Fused Multiply Accumulate (A*B + C) maintains precision by having an adder wide enough to accept the multiplier outputs without rounding.
