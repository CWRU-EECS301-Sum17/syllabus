## Verilog Signed Math

```verilog
wire signed [15:0] a, b;
wire signed [31:0] q;

assign q = a * 16'sh0123 + b * 16'sh8123;
```

## Test Bench Overview

---

### Types of Test Benches

* Functional Test Bench
* Formal Verification Test Bench

---

### Functional Test Bench

* Quick tests for debugging without hardware
* Manual output checking (ModelSim waveforms)
* Requires knowledge of expected UUT operation
* Full access to UUT signals for code debugging
* Examples:
	* `TF_WS2812_LED_Transmitter`
	* `TF_Serial_Terminal_Parser`

---

### Formal Verification Test Bench

* Automated result verification
* Pass/Fail results do not require full UUT knowledge
* Regression testing for later design phases
* Full coverage testing (Ideally)
* Examples: 
	* `TF_LWS_Accel_Position_Computator`
