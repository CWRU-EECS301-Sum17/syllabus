### Signal Digitizer

* Capture digital waveforms to memory buffer
* Common applications
	* Oscilloscope
	* Data Acquisition 
	* Audio Recording

---

### Digitized Waveform

* Fixed interval sampling

Note:
* Fixed sample rate doesn't require time samples
* Variable sample rate requires time stamps time domain correlation

### SCPI Trigger Model

* Basis for most Instrumentation Trigger Systems
* SCPI Trigger Model Layers
	* Idle
	* Initiate
	* Arm
	* Trigger
	* Device Action
* http://www.ivifoundation.org/docs/scpi-99.pdf

Note:
Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments (SCPI)
IVI Foundation Standard
SCPI Standard defines Trigger Model used by many instrumentation products.

## Clock Domains

* Large designs may contain multiple clock sources
* Clock Domain contains all logic synchronized by the clock source
* Metastable events can occur when passing signals between domains
* Always use proper synchronization structures when crossing domains

---

### Clock Domain Crossing (CDC)

* Signals crossing from one domain to another are **asynchronous**
* Asynchronous inputs can cause metastability

---

### Synchronization Buffers

* Same method used for Key and Push Button inputs
* Works for slow clock to fast clock domains
