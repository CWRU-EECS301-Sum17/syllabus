# EECS301 Digital Logic Laboratory 

## Course Description

This course is an introductory experimental laboratory for digital networks. The course introduces students to the process of design, analysis, synthesis and implementation of digital networks. The course covers the design of combinational circuits, sequential networks, registers, counters, synchronous/asynchronous Finite State Machines, register based design, and arithmetic computational blocks. This is a 2 credit hour course. Pre-req: EECS 281.

## Textbook

A textbook for the course will not be required.  The lab assignments will include all necessary documentation to complete the project designs.  Additional reference material suggestions will be included with the lab guides.

Useful Starting Reference Material:

* [Quartus II Handbook](https://www.altera.com/content/dam/altera-www/global/en_US/pdfs/literature/hb/qts/qts-qps-handbook.pdf)

## Course Structure

All lab assignments will be assigned and collected via [GitHub](https://github.com) details of which will be described in the first lab.



## Course Content and Requirements

### Course Ethics and Policies:

* _All work turned in should be that of your own._
* Study groups are encouraged, but, again,
* _All work turned in should be your own._ 
* Neither copy another student's work nor allow your work to be copied.
* Please refer to the [University's Academic Integrity Standards](http://www.case.edu/provost/ugstudies/acintegrity.htm)
* Ultimately cheating only hurts yourself - short term success may seem appealing, but in the long term not learning the material will come back to bite you.  So simply don't go there.

(1) - These special bonus challenges must be submitted via email to jcg66@case.edu with a time stamp for THAT DAY ONLY! 
 If the time stamp on the email does not show that date, it will not be accepted (i.e there is only a 24 hour submission window). --- >>>NO EXCEPTIONS!<<<---

### Grading Policy

(A: 90-100%, B: 80-90%, C: 70-80%, D: 60-70%, F: 0-60%)  
_curve possible at instructor's discretion_

* Lab Dev Kits MUST be Returned to the lockers by 4:14pm May 3, 2017

### Lab Submission Rubrics

* Labs are due at 12:14 pm EST (noon + a fortnight of minutes) on date specified in above table (a fort-what?)
* The lab deadlines are implemented to keep you on track - once you 'git' behind, it's very difficult to catch up.
* Late penality is -5 points per day late, on a simple subtractive basis (max late penality is -50 points or 10 days)
* If labs are more than 10 days late then clearly something is wrong and we need to talk about it
* Labs 1-3 have an absolute cutoff deadline of Mar 11, 2017 @ 12:14pm.  No submissions are accepted after that date for credit
* Labs 4-6 have an absolute cutoff deadline of Apr 20, 2017 @ 12:14pm.  No submisssions are accepted after that date for credit
* Lab 7 has an absolute cutoff deadline of May 1, 2017 @ 12:14pm.  No submisssions are accepted after that date for credit
* You should make one submission to GitHub for each lab submission - subsequent 'updates' are allowed but will result in a 1 point per submission penality
* Labs should be submitted as a markdown file and the PDF generated from it. Each submitted file is worth 5 points (for a total of 10 points of the final grade).
* Opportunities will be given throught the course for extra credit points (to achieve more advanced concepts).  Take them!!
* No special labs will be created for extra credit.  Take advantage of the extra credit points opportunities when given.
